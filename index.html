    <p>It was a dark and stormy night... the rain was just starting as thunder clapped in the distance.</p>
    <p> Me and my four other friends saw an old house with a low light. We need a shelter, so we moved towards the house.
    The door creeked as we opened the door. Once we were all inside, it slammed shut behind us!</p>
