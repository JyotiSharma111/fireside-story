    <p>It was a dark and stormy night... the rain was just starting as thunder clapped in the distance.</p>
    <p> Me and my four other friends saw an old house with a low light. We need a shelter, so we moved towards the house.
    The door creeked as we opened the door. Once we were all inside, it slammed shut behind us!</p>
    <p>We all were shivering.Suddenly, we heard a voice coming from a room .We slowly moved to room and opened the door.
      What we saw was unexpected!!!</p>
